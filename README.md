Final project - Machine Learning Nanodegree
==============

I built a convolutional neural network with data augmentation for iceberg/ship classification.
The idea comes from the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge

The datasets can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge/data
